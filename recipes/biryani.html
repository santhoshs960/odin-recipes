        <h2>Description</h2>

        <p>Chicken biryani is a delicious Pakistani/Indian rice dish 
            that's typically reserved for special occasions such as weddings, 
            parties, or holidays such as Ramadan. It has a lengthy preparation, 
            but the work is definitely worth it. For biryani, basmati rice is the 
            ideal variety to use.</p>

        <h3><strong>steps</strong></h3>

        <ol>
            <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
            <li>Heat 2 tablespoons of oil in a large skillet.
                Fry potatoes in hot oil until lightly browned,
                about 3 to 5 minutes. Remove to a paper towel-lined 
                plate to drain; set aside.</li>
            <li>Stir in yogurt, mint, ground cardamom, and cinnamon stick. 
                Cover and cook over low heat,
                stirring occasionally, until tomatoes are cooked to a pulp.
                It may be necessary to add a little hot water 
                if mixture becomes too dry and starts to
                stick to the pan.</li>
            <li>Heat stock and salt in a medium pot until 
            hot; pour over rice and stir well.</li>
            <li>Reduce heat to very low, cover with a tight-fitting lid, 
                and steam for 20 minutes without lifting the lid or stirring.
            </li>
            <li>biryani is ready</li>
